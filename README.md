# Docker Multi-Container Project: WordPress with MySQL

## Project Overview
This project sets up a WordPress site with a MySQL database using Docker and Docker Compose. By leveraging Dockerâ€™s multi-container orchestration, WordPress and MySQL are isolated in their own containers, creating a portable and easily replicable environment for CMS-based web applications. This setup enables developers to deploy WordPress locally on `http://localhost:8080` and connect it seamlessly with a MySQL backend.
